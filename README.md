#### INTRODUCTION
This repository has three JavaScript solutions designed to perform specific tasks: calculating grades, detecting speeding violations, and calculating net salary. Each solution is self-contained and can be tested independently.

#### SOLUTIONS

## Grading 

A simple program that takes a numeric grade and assigns a letter grade based on predefined ranges.

//eg: let GRADE = 49; 
// Logic to determine the grade...

E: Less than 40
D-: 40 to 49
C-: 50 to 59
B-: 60 to 79
A: 80 and above
you can change the GRADE variable to test different grades and see the output in the console.
## Speed Detector

This program checks the speed of a vehicle against a speed limit and calculates demerit points based on the excess speed.
javascript

function speedDetector(speed) {
    const speedLimit = 70;
    // Logic to determine points and suspension...
}

# Output:
It isplays "Ok" if speed is below the limit.
Calculates demerit points based on the formula: (speed - speedLimit) / 5.
If demerit points exceed 12, it indicates license suspension.

## Net Salary Calculator

A web-based application that calculates net salary based on basic salary and benefits, while accounting for deductions like P.A.Y.E, NHIF, and NSSF.

Calculations:

Gross Salary: basic salary + benefits
Deductions:
P.A.Y.E: 25% of gross salary
NHIF: 2% of basic salary
NSSF: 12% of basic salary
Net Salary: gross salary - deductions
